#### Role Based Access Control (RBAC)

Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) in Kubernetes is a method of regulating access to computer or network resources based on the roles of individual users within an enterprise. In the context of Kubernetes, RBAC allows you to control who has access to the Kubernetes API and what they can do with those resources

    - Rules: A rule is a set of operations (verbs) that can be carried out on a group of resources which belong to different API Groups.

##### kubectl explain role.rules 

    ```
     kubectl explain role.rules     
GROUP:      rbac.authorization.k8s.io
KIND:       Role
VERSION:    v1

FIELD: rules <[]PolicyRule>

DESCRIPTION:
    Rules holds all the PolicyRules for this Role
    PolicyRule holds information that describes a policy rule, but does not
    contain information about who the rule applies to or which namespace the
    rule applies to.
    
FIELDS:
  apiGroups     <[]string>
    APIGroups is the name of the APIGroup that contains the resources.  If
    multiple API groups are specified, any action requested against one of the
    enumerated resources in any API group will be allowed. "" represents the
    core API group and "*" represents all API groups.

  nonResourceURLs       <[]string>
    NonResourceURLs is a set of partial urls that a user should have access to.
    *s are allowed, but only as the full, final step in the path Since
    non-resource URLs are not namespaced, this field is only applicable for
    ClusterRoles referenced from a ClusterRoleBinding. Rules can either apply to
    API resources (such as "pods" or "secrets") or non-resource URL paths (such
    as "/api"),  but not both.

  resourceNames <[]string>
    ResourceNames is an optional white list of names that the rule applies to.
    An empty set means that everything is allowed.

  resources     <[]string>
    Resources is a list of resources this rule applies to. '*' represents all
    resources.

  verbs <[]string> -required-
    Verbs is a list of Verbs that apply to ALL the ResourceKinds contained in
    this rule. '*' represents all verbs.

    ```

    - Roles and ClusterRoles: Both consist of rules. The difference between a Role and a ClusterRole is the scope: in a Role, the rules are applicable to a single namespace, whereas a ClusterRole is cluster-wide, so the rules are applicable to more than one namespace. ClusterRoles can define rules for cluster-scoped resources (such as nodes) as well. Both Roles and ClusterRoles are mapped as API Resources inside our cluster.


##### kubectl explain role
    ```
kubernetesdaily.github.io git:(main) ‚úó kubectl explain role      
GROUP:      rbac.authorization.k8s.io
KIND:       Role
VERSION:    v1

DESCRIPTION:
    Role is a namespaced, logical grouping of PolicyRules that can be referenced
    as a unit by a RoleBinding.
    
FIELDS:
  apiVersion    <string>
    APIVersion defines the versioned schema of this representation of an object.
    Servers should convert recognized schemas to the latest internal value, and
    may reject unrecognized values. More info:
    https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md#resources

  kind  <string>
    Kind is a string value representing the REST resource this object
    represents. Servers may infer this from the endpoint the client submits
    requests to. Cannot be updated. In CamelCase. More info:
    https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md#types-kinds

  metadata      <ObjectMeta>
    Standard object's metadata.

  rules <[]PolicyRule>
    Rules holds all the PolicyRules for this Role

    ```

##### kubectl explain clusterroles

```
kubernetesdaily.github.io git:(main) ‚úó kubectl explain clusterroles
GROUP:      rbac.authorization.k8s.io
KIND:       ClusterRole
VERSION:    v1

DESCRIPTION:
    ClusterRole is a cluster level, logical grouping of PolicyRules that can be
    referenced as a unit by a RoleBinding or ClusterRoleBinding.
    
FIELDS:
  aggregationRule       <AggregationRule>
    AggregationRule is an optional field that describes how to build the Rules
    for this ClusterRole. If AggregationRule is set, then the Rules are
    controller managed and direct changes to Rules will be stomped by the
    controller.

  apiVersion    <string>
    APIVersion defines the versioned schema of this representation of an object.
    Servers should convert recognized schemas to the latest internal value, and
    may reject unrecognized values. More info:
    https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md#resources

  kind  <string>
    Kind is a string value representing the REST resource this object
    represents. Servers may infer this from the endpoint the client submits
    requests to. Cannot be updated. In CamelCase. More info:
    https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md#types-kinds

  metadata      <ObjectMeta>
    Standard object's metadata.

  rules <[]PolicyRule>
    Rules holds all the PolicyRules for this ClusterRole
```


    - Subjects: These correspond to the entity that attempts an operation in the cluster. There are three types of subjects:

    - User Accounts: These are global, and meant for humans or processes living outside the cluster. There is no associated resource API Object in the Kubernetes cluster.

    - Service Accounts: This kind of account is namespaced and meant for intra-cluster processes running inside pods, which want to authenticate against the API.

    - Groups: This is used for referring to multiple accounts. There are some groups created by default such as cluster-admin (explained in later sections).

    - RoleBindings and ClusterRoleBindings: Just as the names imply, these bind subjects to roles (i.e. the operations a given user can perform). As for Roles and ClusterRoles, the difference lies in the scope: a RoleBinding will make the rules effective inside a namespace, whereas a ClusterRoleBinding will make the rules effective in all namespaces.

#### kubectl explain rolebinding

    ```
    ‚úó kubectl explain rolebindings
GROUP:      rbac.authorization.k8s.io
KIND:       RoleBinding
VERSION:    v1

DESCRIPTION:
    RoleBinding references a role, but does not contain it.  It can reference a
    Role in the same namespace or a ClusterRole in the global namespace. It adds
    who information via Subjects and namespace information by which namespace it
    exists in.  RoleBindings in a given namespace only have effect in that
    namespace.
    
FIELDS:
  apiVersion    <string>

With Minikube, you can experiment with RBAC in a local Kubernetes setup. Minikube comes with RBAC enabled by default if you start it with a Kubernetes version that supports RBAC

```

üèÑ  Done! kubectl is now configured to use "minikube" cluster and "default" namespace by default
```

#### Create new namespace 

Execute the kubectl create command to create the namespace (as the admin user):
    
``` 
kubernetesdaily.github.io git:(main) ‚úó kubectl create namespace kubedaily
namespace/kubedaily created
```

#### Create the user credentials

genarete the user credentials using openssl command 

```
 openssl genrsa -out kubedaily.key 2048
Generating RSA private key, 2048 bit long modulus
................................................................+++++
.............................................................................+++++
e is 65537 (0x10001)

```
Create a certificate sign request  using openssl command 

```
 kubernetesdaily.github.io git:(main) ‚úó openssl req -new -key kubedaily.key -out kubedaily.csr -subj "/CN=kubedaily/O=sangam"
```
 
```
‚ûú  .minikube ls
addons              ca.pem              certs               key.pem             machine_client.lock proxy-client-ca.crt
ca.crt              cache               config              last_update_check   machines            proxy-client-ca.key
ca.key              cert.pem            files               logs                profiles            tunnels.json
``` 

```
 kubernetesdaily.github.io git:(main) ‚úó kubectl config set-credentials kubedaily --client-certificate=/.certs/kubedaily.crt  --client-key=/.certs/kubedaily.key 
User "kubedaily" set.
kubectl config set-context kubedaily-context --cluster=minikube --namespace=kubedaily --user=sangam
```
Now you should get an access denied error when using the kubectl CLI with this configuration file. This is expected as we have not defined any permitted operations for this user.

```
 kubectl --context=kubedaily-context get pods
```

####  Create the role for managing deployments

```
kind: Role
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
metadata:
  namespace: kubedaily
  name: sangam
rules:
- apiGroups: ["", "extensions", "apps"]
  resources: ["deployments", "replicasets", "pods"]
  verbs: ["get", "list", "watch", "create", "update", "patch", "delete"] # You can also use ["*"]

```

#### Create the role binding

```
kind: RoleBinding
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
metadata:
  name: sangam-binding
  namespace: kubedaily
subjects:
- kind: User
  name: sangam
  apiGroup: ""
roleRef:
  kind: Role
  name: sangam
  apiGroup: ""

```

```
‚ûú  kubernetesdaily.github.io git:(main) ‚úó kubectl create -f rolebinding-deployment-manager.yaml
rolebinding.rbac.authorization.k8s.io/sangam-binding created
```
