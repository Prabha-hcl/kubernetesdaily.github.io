sangam@sangam:~$ runc 
NAME:
   runc - Open Container Initiative runtime

runc is a command line client for running applications packaged according to
the Open Container Initiative (OCI) format and is a compliant implementation of the
Open Container Initiative specification.

runc integrates well with existing process supervisors to provide a production
container runtime environment for applications. It can be used with your
existing process monitoring tools and the container will be spawned as a
direct child of the process supervisor.

Containers are configured using bundles. A bundle for a container is a directory
that includes a specification file named "config.json" and a root filesystem.
The root filesystem contains the contents of the container.

To start a new instance of a container:

    # runc run [ -b bundle ] <container-id>

Where "<container-id>" is your name for the instance of the container that you
are starting. The name you provide for the container instance must be unique on
your host. Providing the bundle directory using "-b" is optional. The default
value for "bundle" is the current directory.

### create directory 

sangam@sangam:~$ mkdir runc-sangam-demo
sangam@sangam:~$ cd runc-sangam-demo/



once installed, you can start using runc:

### Creating a Container

Create a Root Filesystem: You need a root filesystem for your container. You can create a simple one or use an existing Docker image.
Example: mkdir rootfs and unpack a Docker image into it using docker export and tar.

mkdir rootfs

# Export the filesystem of an existing Docker image (e.g., alphine)

```
sudo docker pull alpine
Using default tag: latest
latest: Pulling from library/alpine
bca4290a9639: Pull complete 
Digest: sha256:c5b1261d6d3e43071626931fc004f70149baeba2c8ec672bd4f27761f8e1ad6b
Status: Downloaded newer image for alpine:latest
docker.io/library/alpine:latest

docker export $(docker create alpine) | tar -C rootfs -xvf -


```

### it will give us two files 

```
sangam@sangam:~/runc-sangam-demo$ ls
config.json  rootfs

```

### check it out config.json file 


```
sangam@sangam:~/runc-sangam-demo$ cat config.json

#### runc run - create and run a container

```
runc spec --help
NAME:
   runc spec - create a new specification file

USAGE:
   runc spec [command options] [arguments...]

DESCRIPTION:
   The spec command creates the new specification file named "config.json" for
the bundle.

The spec generated is just a starter file. Editing of the spec is required to
achieve desired results. For example, the newly generated spec includes an args
parameter that is initially set to call the "sh" command when the container is
started. Calling "sh" may work for an ubuntu container or busybox, but will not
work for containers that do not include the "sh" program.

EXAMPLE:
  To run docker's hello-world container one needs to set the args parameter
in the spec to call hello. This can be done using the sed command or a text
editor. The following commands create a bundle for hello-world, change the
default args parameter in the spec from "sh" to "/hello", then run the hello
command in a new hello-world container named container1:

    mkdir hello
    cd hello
    docker pull hello-world
    docker export $(docker create hello-world) > hello-world.tar
    mkdir rootfs
    tar -C rootfs -xf hello-world.tar
    runc spec
    sed -i 's;"sh";"/hello";' config.json
    runc run container1

In the run command above, "container1" is the name for the instance of the
container that you are starting. The name you provide for the container instance
must be unique on your host.

An alternative for generating a customized spec config is to use "oci-runtime-tool", the
sub-command "oci-runtime-tool generate" has lots of options that can be used to do any
customizations as you want, see runtime-tools (https://github.com/opencontainers/runtime-tools)
to get more information.

When starting a container through runc, runc needs root privilege. If not
already running as root, you can use sudo to give runc root privilege. For
example: "sudo runc start container1" will give runc root privilege to start the
container on your host.

Alternatively, you can start a rootless container, which has the ability to run
without root privileges. For this to work, the specification file needs to be
adjusted accordingly. You can pass the parameter --rootless to this command to
generate a proper rootless spec file.

Note that --rootless is not needed when you execute runc as the root in a user namespace
created by an unprivileged user.


OPTIONS:
   --bundle value, -b value  path to the root of the bundle directory
   --rootless                generate a configuration for a rootless container
