### History of ContainerD 


1. **Origin from Docker:** The origins of containerd can be traced back to Docker, the popular container platform. Docker initially included all components required to run a container in a single monolithic binary, which included the container runtime. As Docker grew, there was a need to break down this monolithic structure into more manageable, modular components.

**Announcement and Spin-Off (2016):** Docker announced containerd in December 2016 as a core component split off from the Docker Engine. This move was part of Docker's effort to modularize its platform. containerd was designed to manage the entire container lifecycle, including image transfer and storage, container execution and supervision, low-level storage, and network attachments.
Donation to CNCF (2017): In March 2017, Docker donated containerd to the Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF), the same foundation that hosts Kubernetes. This move was aimed at fostering an open, neutral, and community-driven base for container operations.

**Graduation from CNCF (2019):** containerd graduated from CNCF in February 2019, which indicated its maturity, stable API, and growing adoption. Graduation from CNCF is a significant milestone that reflects a projectâ€™s sustainability and adherence to certain standards of governance.


**Adoption and Usage:** Over the years, containerd has seen significant adoption in the industry. It is used by Kubernetes, as well as cloud providers and Linux distributions for their container operations. This wide adoption is due to its simplicity, robustness, and the strong community support it has garnered.
